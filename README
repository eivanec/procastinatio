== Abstract

A simple to-do list project.

== Description/Commentary

1. I used act_as_authenticated for the basic login/signup part of the application, and for providing the user model (with niceties such as current_user and :login_required). I realize now act_as_authenticated is deprecated in favour of RESTful auth, but the current basic project it proved adequate.
2. I defined three additional models:
  1. Home: just a wrapper for the main, very simple, view.
  2. List: this has a text description and a :has_many link to...
  3. Todo: a text body that :belongs_to List.
3. As a todo always belongs to a list, I ended up using lists' views for most functionality.
4. This projects comes configured with SQLite3. In a production environment (and indeed in a serious development environment) I would of course have used something different, such as MySQL or PostgreSQL.

== RESTful

* Rails 2+ is RESTful by default, so I just had to make sure the routes for my controllers were RESTful by design:

>> ActionController::Routing::Routes.draw do |map|
>>
>>   map.resources :lists, :has_many => :todos
>>   map.root :controller => "home"
>>   # This is necessary because I had to comment out the default 'connect' statements so that, for example, todos didn't end up being called without a list id.
>>   map.connect 'account/:action/:id', :controller => 'account', :action => :action
>>
>> end

* rake routes
